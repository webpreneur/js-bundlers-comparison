/dist will be the folder created after the bundle process and will contain all the bundled files.

/src is the folder containing the entry point from which the bundler will start the bundle process.

/styles is the folder containing the original styles file, before the bundle.

index.html is the file containing what we'll see in the browser.

package.json is the file where all the dependencies, scripts and some configurations are stored.

[*.config.js] is the file where all the config for the bundler is defined. This file is optional for every bundler in this list, but highly recommended. * will be replaced accordingly by the name of the bundler.
